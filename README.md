# ERC20 AndVault Contracts

This repository contains smart contracts for ERC20 tokens and an accompanying vault contract. These contracts facilitate the creation and management of ERC20 tokens along with secure storage in a vault.

## Contracts

1. **ERC20.sol**: This contract implements the ERC20 token standard, providing basic functionality such as transfer, approve, and transferFrom.

2. **AndVault.sol**: The vault contract serves as a secure storage for the ERC20 tokens. It implements features like deposit, withdraw, and transfer tokens securely.

## Usage

1. Deploy ERC20.sol to create your ERC20 token.

2. Deploy AndVault.sol and pass the ERC20 token address as a constructor argument.

3. Interact with the ERC20 token and the vault contract using their respective functions.
